# Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis

**Internship Project – Data Science**

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing marketing campaign performance using structured customer, campaign, and outcome data. The goal is to clean and validate the data, perform exploratory analysis, generate business insights, and build a simple baseline machine learning model to understand customer purchase behavior.

The project follows a step-by-step data science workflow, similar to a real-world industry task.

## Objectives

- Collect and organize marketing campaign data
- Clean and validate the dataset for analysis
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Analyze key business metrics such as ROI, CTR, and conversion rate
- Visualize trends and patterns in campaign performance
---

## Dataset Description

The data consists of three main components:

- **Customer Master**: Customer demographics and income details
- **Campaign Interactions**: Campaign impressions, clicks, costs, and engagement
- **Campaign Outcome**: Purchase outcome, revenue, and ROI

These datasets are merged to form a single cleaned dataset used for analysis.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection

- Loaded structured data from Excel sheets
- Converted data into CSV format for further processing

### 2. Data Cleaning

- Removed duplicate records
- Filtered invalid values (negative or zero income and campaign cost)
- Handled derived metrics like Click-Through Rate (CTR)

### 3. Data Validation

- Verified unique IDs
- Checked value ranges (e.g., CTR between 0 and 1)
- Ensured consistency after merging datasets

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Descriptive statistics
- Campaign-wise ROI and conversion analysis
- Discount impact analysis
- Customer segmentation (loyalty tier, device type, income group)

### 5. Data Visualization

- Monthly trends for ROI, CTR, conversion rate, and revenue
- Campaign type performance comparison
- Segment-based performance trends

### 6. Insight Generation

- Identified top-performing campaign types
- Analyzed customer segments with higher conversion rates
- Observed seasonal and time-based performance patterns
